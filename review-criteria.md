This document contains the points that will be evaluated by the open science reviewer. It can be considered as the review template. 


Is the replication package?
--------


Downloadable behind a public URL?

-   Does the data and code lie behind a single URL[? (Recommendation: it
    should be the case)]{.c2}

Archived?

-   Is the replication package hosted on an persistent,
    archived repository? (Recommendation: even the submitted version

    -   are the naming conventions documented?    

Complete?

-   Does the replication package contain everything required to understand and/or recompute all data, numbers and figures presented in the paper?

Exercisable? (if the paper contains results based on code)

-   Does the code compile and execute given the instructions in the package?
-   Does the code only depend on publicly-available modules and libraries?

Licensed?

-   Does the replication package contain an appropriate license for the code or data?
    -   We strongly encourage that the replication package contains a license.
