This document contains the points that will be evaluated by the open science reviewer. It can be considered as the review template.

Is the replication package?
--------

Downloadable behind a public URL?

- Does the data and code lie behind a single URL (Recommendation: Yes)?

Archived?

- Is the replication package hosted on a persistent, archived repository? (Recommendation: Even the submitted version should be hosted on an archived repository, such as [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) or [archive.org](https://archive.org/)

Documented?

- Is the replication package properly documented?

- does the replication package contain an inventory of artifacts (files and folders)?
- are the used file formats documented?
- are the naming conventions documented?

Complete?

- Does the replication package contain everything required to understand and/or recompute all data, numbers, and figures presented in the paper?

Exercisable? (if the paper contains results based on code)

- Does the code compile and execute given the instructions in the package?
- Does the code only depend on publicly available modules and libraries?

Licensed?

- Does the replication package contain an appropriate license for the code or data?
- We strongly encourage the replication package to contain a license.
- The Open Science board suggests the CC-BY version 4.0, which is is suitable for data
